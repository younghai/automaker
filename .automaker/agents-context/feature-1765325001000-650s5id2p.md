🔧 Tool: Glob
Let me look at the project structure more specifically to understand where the settings section is:
🔧 Tool: Bash
I found the settings view. Let me read it along with some other views to understand the theme that should be applied:

Now I can see the issue. Looking at the settings-view.tsx, I can see:

1. The **API Keys Section** and **Appearance Section** use the theme-consistent styling with `border-border`, `bg-card`, and theme-aware text colors like `text-foreground`, `text-muted-foreground`.

2. However, the **Kanban Card Display Section** (lines 556-628) uses hardcoded dark theme colors:
   - `border-white/10` instead of `border-border`
   - `bg-zinc-900/50` instead of `bg-card`
   - `text-white` instead of `text-foreground`
   - `text-zinc-400` instead of `text-muted-foreground`
   - `text-zinc-300` instead of `text-foreground`
   - `text-zinc-500` instead of `text-muted-foreground`
   - `bg-white/5` and `bg-zinc-950/50` instead of theme-aware colors

Let me also check the context-view and board-view for more examples of consistent theming patterns:
🔧 Tool: Read
Now I have a complete understanding of the theme system. The issue is clear:

1. The **Kanban Card Display Section** in `settings-view.tsx` (lines 556-628) uses hardcoded dark theme styles like `text-white`, `text-zinc-400`, `bg-zinc-900/50`, `border-white/10`, etc.

2. It should use theme variables like:
   - `text-foreground` instead of `text-white`
   - `text-muted-foreground` instead of `text-zinc-400`, `text-zinc-500`
   - `bg-card` instead of `bg-zinc-900/50`
   - `border-border` instead of `border-white/10`
   - `bg-secondary` instead of `bg-white/5`
   - `bg-input` instead of `bg-zinc-950/50`
   - `bg-accent` instead of `bg-white/5`

Let me also check the "Back to Home" button at the end of the file which also has hardcoded styles:

Looking at the code, I need to fix:

1. **Lines 556-628 - Kanban Card Display Section** - Replace hardcoded colors with theme variables
2. **Lines 649 - Back to Home button** - Also uses hardcoded `bg-white/5`, `hover:bg-white/10`, `text-white`, `border-white/10`

Let me make these changes:
🔧 Tool: Edit
Now let me also fix the "Back to Home" button which has hardcoded styles:
🔧 Tool: Edit
Let me verify if there are any other hardcoded theme values in the file that I might have missed:
🔧 Tool: Grep
There are two more instances of `text-zinc-500` that need to be fixed. Let me see the context around them:
🔧 Tool: Read

🔧 Tool: Read
I can see these are description/helper texts. Let me fix these to use the theme-consistent `text-muted-foreground`:
🔧 Tool: Edit

🔧 Tool: Edit
Let me verify there are no more hardcoded theme values:
🔧 Tool: Grep
All the hardcoded theme values have been replaced. Let me now verify the file compiles properly by running a quick syntax check:
🔧 Tool: Bash
Those are just missing configuration errors for standalone TSC run (project path aliases and JSX config), not actual code issues. Let me try the proper Next.js build check:
🔧 Tool: Bash
The build errors are pre-existing issues (missing npm packages and network issues with fonts), not related to my changes. The actual TypeScript/React code in the settings-view.tsx file is syntactically correct.

Let me double-check by looking at the final state of the modified sections:
🔧 Tool: Read
The changes have been applied correctly. Now the Settings View uses the consistent theme classes:

Now let me mark this feature as verified using the UpdateFeatureStatus tool:
🔧 Tool: mcp__automaker-tools__UpdateFeatureStatus
The feature has been implemented successfully. Here's a summary of what was done:

## Feature Complete: Fix Settings Design to Use Theme Variables

### Changes Made to `app/src/components/views/settings-view.tsx`:

1. **Kanban Card Display Section** - Replaced all hardcoded dark theme colors with theme-aware CSS variables:
   - Container: `border-white/10 bg-zinc-900/50` → `border-border bg-card`
   - Headers: `text-white` → `text-foreground`
   - Descriptions: `text-zinc-400` → `text-muted-foreground`
   - Labels: `text-zinc-300` → `text-foreground`
   - Button selected state: `bg-white/5 border-brand-500 text-white` → `bg-accent border-brand-500 text-foreground`
   - Button default state: `bg-zinc-950/50 border-white/10 text-zinc-400` → `bg-input border-border text-muted-foreground`
   - Helper text: `text-zinc-500` → `text-muted-foreground`

2. **Back to Home Button** - Updated to use theme variables:
   - `bg-white/5 hover:bg-white/10 text-white border border-white/10` → `bg-secondary hover:bg-accent text-secondary-foreground border border-border`

3. **API Key Help Text** (2 locations) - Updated muted text color:
   - `text-zinc-500` → `text-muted-foreground`

These changes ensure the Settings View now properly respects all 12+ themes defined in the application (dark, light, retro, dracula, nord, monokai, tokyonight, solarized, gruvbox, catppuccin, onedark, synthwave).

The feature is now in `waiting_approval` status for manual review since `skipTests=true`.✅ Verifying implementation for: Fix the design of this section to use the theme we have elsewhere
